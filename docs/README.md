# Docs
Here you can find documentation templates for the wikis, taking into account mechanics, electronics and programming systems/modules.

The objective of documentation is to treat your module as a whole, mentioning what the developer/designer needs to know to run and understand the functionality of your work.

Remember that each area and project is different, so feel free to personalize the content of your documentation!
